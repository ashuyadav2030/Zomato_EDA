# Project Overview:
This project involves analyzing a dataset of restaurants in Bengaluru to gain insights into the restaurant landscape. The dataset provides information about restaurant services, ratings, locations, and types. The objective is to identify trends, patterns, and correlations within the data to understand factors influencing restaurant popularity, customer satisfaction, and business performance.

# Goals:

    Analyze the dataset and derive valuable insights about the Bengaluru restaurant landscape.
    Identify the proportion of restaurants offering online food delivery services.
    Determine the relationship between table booking services and restaurant ratings.
    Identify the locations with the highest number of restaurants.
    Explore the relationship between restaurant types and ratings.

# Problems:

    Missing data or inconsistencies in the dataset may affect the analysis.
    Understanding the factors influencing restaurant popularity and customer satisfaction requires careful examination of various attributes.
    Interpreting the results and translating them into actionable recommendations can be challenging.

# Approach and Methodology:

    Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution, identify missing values, and clean the data if required.
    Analyze the proportion of restaurants offering online food delivery services by calculating the percentage.
    Investigate the relationship between table booking services and ratings by comparing the average ratings of restaurants with and without table booking.
    Determine the count of restaurants in each location to identify the locations with the highest number of restaurants.
    Analyze the ratings of different restaurant types and compare the average ratings to understand the relationship between restaurant types and ratings.

# Technical Details:

    Utilize programming languages like Python for data analysis and visualization.
    Use libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
    Apply statistical techniques to analyze and interpret the data.
    Employ data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to handle missing values and inconsistencies.

# Challenges and Solutions:

    Missing data: Implement techniques such as imputation or removal to handle missing values.
    Data inconsistencies: Perform data cleaning and preprocessing steps to address inconsistencies in the dataset.
    Complex relationships: Utilize statistical analysis and visualization techniques to explore and interpret relationships between variables.

# Results and Outcomes:
The analysis of the dataset revealed the following key insights:

    A significant portion of restaurants in the dataset offer online food delivery services.
    Restaurants without table booking services tend to have lower ratings.
    The BTM location has the highest number of restaurants, followed by Whitefield, Indiranagar, and other locations.
    "Drinks & Nightlife" and "Buffet" restaurant types tend to receive higher ratings compared to others.

These insights provide valuable information about the Bengaluru restaurant landscape and can guide decision-making for stakeholders such as restaurant owners, customers, and investors. The project highlights the importance of online food delivery services, the impact of table booking on ratings, and the significance of location and restaurant type on customer satisfaction.
